It was one of the most challengeing data science problems I have tackled as for this challenge no data was provided and we had to go get our own data and secondly there was no right way to tackle partisan voter turn out.

But there were also factors such as candidate fundraising, how popular they were, and whether or not they were an incumbent that we had to factor into our model.”
